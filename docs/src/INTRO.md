# A Julia interface to Stan's cmdstan executable

## Stan.jl

[Stan](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan) is a system for statistical modeling, data analysis, and prediction. It is extensively used in social, biological, and physical sciences, engineering, and business. The Stan language and the interfaces to execute a Stan language program are documented [here](http://mc-stan.org/documentation/).

[Cmdstan](http://mc-stan.org/interfaces/cmdstan.html) is the shell/command line interface to run Stan language programs. 

[Stan.jl](https://github.com/StanJulia/Stan.jl) wraps the cmdstan methods and captures the draws for further processing.

## StanJulia overview

Stan.jl is part of the [StanJulia Github organization](https://github.com/StanJulia) set of packages.

Stan.jl is the primary option in StanJulia to capture draws from a Stan language program.  How to use the underlying method packages in StanJulia, e.g. StanSample.jl, StanOptimize.jl and StanVariational.jl, is illustrated in Stan.jl and in a much broader context in [StatisticalRethinking.jl](https://github.com/StatisticalRethinkingJulia).

Stan.jl is not the only Stan mcmc option in Julia. Valid other options are PyCall.jl/PyStan and StanRun.jl. In addition, Julia provides other, pure Julia, mcmc options such as DynamicHMC.jl, Turing.jl and Mamba.jl.

On a very high level, a typical workflow for using Stan.jl looks like:

```
using Stan

# Define a Stan language program.
bernoulli = "..."

# Create and compile a SampleModel, an OptimizeModel, etc.:
sm = SampleModel(...)

# Run the compiled Stan languauge program and collect draws:
rc = stan_sample(...)

if success(rc)
  # Retrieve Stan's `stansummary` executable result:
  sdf = read_summary(sm)

  # Display the summary as a DataFrame:
  sdf |> display

  # Extract the draws from the SampleModel:
  named_tuple_of_samples = read_samples(sm)

end
```
This workflow creates a KeyedArray chnains object with the draws, the default value for `read_samples(...)`.

If a DataFrame (with all chains appended) is preferred:
```
df = read_samples(sm, :dataframe)
```
Other options are `:namedtuple`, `:mcmcchains`, `:particles`, etc. See
```
?read_samples
```
for more details. Walkthrough and Walkthrough2 show StanSample.jl in action.
