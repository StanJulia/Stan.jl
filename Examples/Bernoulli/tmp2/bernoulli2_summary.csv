# Inference for Stan model: bernoulli2_model
# 4 chains: each with iter=(1000,1000,1000,1000); warmup=(1000,1000,1000,1000); thin=(1,1,1,1); 8000 iterations saved.
# 
# Warmup took (0.018, 0.018, 0.019, 0.019) seconds, 0.074 seconds total
# Sampling took (0.020, 0.019, 0.019, 0.019) seconds, 0.077 seconds total
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
